    STAGED,

    /**
     * A slightly modified version of the {@link #STAGED} Builder pattern variant.
     * It only differs from {@link #STAGED} in the treatment of optional properties
     * (those coming from fields or constructor/static method parameters annotated with {@link Opt}).
     * <p>
     * While the {@link #STAGED} variant groups all optional properties into one
     * interface that is obtained at the end of the build process
     * (after all the required properties have been set),
     * this style maintains the same order of properties as they were declared in
     * either the class as fields, or in a constructor/static method as parameters
     * (depending on where was the {@link Builder} annotation placed).
     * The way properties are made optional is that they can be 'skipped' when building the target instance.
     * This is achieved by the interfaces for each optional property having more than one method -
     * they include also all setters for consecutive properties up to (and including) the first next required one.
     * <p>
     * The advantage of this style over {@link #STAGED} is that it allows making a previously required property optional,
     * but still maintain backwards compatibility with existing code that already used the previously generated builder.
     * Because the {@link #STAGED} variant groups all optional properties into a single interface,
     * using it means only the last required property can be made optional without breaking backwards compatibility.
     * However, this style allows changing any required property to optional, not just the last one,
     * and that change won't affect any existing code written against the previously generated builder.
     * <p>
     * For example, given this code:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * public final class FullName {
     *     public final String firstName, middleName, lastName;
     *
     *    {@literal @}Builder(style = BuilderStyle.STAGED)
     *     public FullName(String firstName, String middleName, String lastName) {
     *         this.firstName = firstName;
     *         this.middleName = middleName;
     *         this.lastName = lastName;
     *     }
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * If later we decide to make {@code middleName} optional,
     * that change would break the following code:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *     FullName fullName = FullNameBuilder.fullName()
     *         .firstName("William")
     *         .middleName("H")
     *         .lastName("Macy")
     *         .build();
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * Since {@code middleName()} would now have to be called after {@code lastName()}, not before it.
     * <p>
     * However, if we use the {@code STAGED_PRESERVING_ORDER} style instead:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * public final class FullName {
     *     public final String firstName, middleName, lastName;
     *
     *    {@literal @}Builder(style = BuilderStyle.STAGED_PRESERVING_ORDER)
     *     public FullName(String firstName, @Opt String middleName, String lastName) {
     *         this.firstName = firstName;
     *         this.middleName = middleName;
     *         this.lastName = lastName;
     *     }
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * This code would still work:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *     FullName fullName = FullNameBuilder.fullName()
     *         .firstName("William")
     *         .middleName("H")
     *         .lastName("Macy")
     *         .build();
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * And the following code would also work:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *     FullName fullName = FullNameBuilder.fullName()
     *         .firstName("William")
     *         // no middleName() call here - optional property
     *         .lastName("Macy")
     *         .build();
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * Note that this style works best if either the built class has a small number of properties,
     * or if there is a natural order to those properties,
     * like in the {@code FullName} example above.
     * The reason why is that there is only a single spot where a given optional property can be set
     * (for example, {@code middleName()} above can only be called right after calling {@code firstName()}),
     * which might make it difficult to find if the class has a large amount of properties without an obvious order to them.
     * This is different from the {@link #STAGED} style,
     * where all optional properties can be set right before calling {@code build()},
     * and they can be set in any order, which makes them more easily discoverable.

    /**
     * A Functional variant of the Builder pattern.
     * It is inspired by a <a href="https://glaforge.dev/posts/2024/01/16/java-functional-builder-approach">blog article</a>
     * from Guillaume Laforge, creator of the Groovy programming language.
     * <p>
     * In this variant, an instance of a Builder is not explicitly used -
     * instead, a static factory method is generated on the Builder class
     * that directly returns an instance of the target class.
     * The arguments of that method are generated interfaces.
     * Each required property has its own interface,
     * while all optional properties share one interface.
     * <p>
     * Instances of these interfaces are obtained by calling static factory methods generated on the Builder class
     * (static methods for the optional properties are nested inside an additional {@code Optional} class,
     * for discoverability), and passing them the value for a given property.
     * Typically, you would use Java's static imports to bring those static methods directly into the scope that creates the instance.
     * <p>
     * For example, given this value class:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * package example;
     *
     * public final class FullName {
     *     public final String firstName, middleName, lastName;
     *
     *    {@literal @}Builder(style = BuilderStyle.FUNCTIONAL)
     *     public FullName(String firstName, @Opt String middleName, String lastName) {
     *         this.firstName = firstName;
     *         this.middleName = middleName;
     *         this.lastName = lastName;
     *     }
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * You use the generated Builder like so:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * import static example.FullNameBuilder.firstName;
     * import static example.FullNameBuilder.lastName;
     * import static example.FullNameBuilder.middleName;
     *
     * FullName fullName = FullNameBuilder.fullName(
     *     firstName("John"), // this is required
     *     lastName("Doe"),  // this is required
     *     middleName("Muriel") // this is optional
     * );
     * </code></pre>
