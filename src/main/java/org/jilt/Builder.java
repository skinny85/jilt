/**
 * The @Builder annotation marks a class, constructor or static method
 * for Builder class generation.
 * <p>
 * If you're not familiar with the Builder design pattern, the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern#Java">Wikipedia article on the subject</a>
 * is a good starting point.
 * <p>
 * When the @Builder annotation is present on an element, the Jilt annotation processor
 * will pick it up, and generate classes that implement the Builder design pattern.
 * What exactly will it generate depends on where was the annotation placed:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *          You can place it directly on the class you want to generate the Builder for.
 *          In that case, the properties of the Builder will be all of the instance fields
 *          of the annotated class (you can use the {@link Builder.Ignore} annotation to
 *          exclude any fields you don't want present in the resulting Builder), in the order
 *          they were declared in the class. The processor expects that the class will have a
 *          constructor taking all of the (non-Ignored) fields as parameters (in the same order
 *          they were declared in the class), and it will use it in the <code>build</code> method
 *          to construct an instance of the class.
 *          <p>
 *          For example, given this code:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *     {@literal @}Builder
 *      public final class Person {
 *          public final String name;
 *          public final boolean isAdult;
 *
 *         {@literal @}Builder.Ignore
 *          private String socialSecurityNumber = "***-**-****";
 *
 *          public Person(String name, boolean isAdult) {
 *              this.name = name;
 *              this.isAdult = isAdult;
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *
 *          ...Jilt will generate the following Builder class:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *      public class PersonBuilder {
 *          public static PersonBuilder person() {
 *              return new PersonBuilder();
 *          }
 *
 *          private String name;
 *          private boolean isAdult;
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder name(String name) {
 *              this.name = name;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder isAdult(boolean isAdult) {
 *              this.isAdult = isAdult;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public Person build() {
 *              return new Person(name, isAdult);
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>
 *          You can place it on a constructor of the class you want to generate the Builder for.
 *          In that case, the properties of the Builder will be all of the constructor parameters
 *          (in the same order they were declared in the constructor). The <code>build</code>
 *          method will call the annotated constructor to obtain an instance of the target class.
 *          <p>
 *          For example, given this code:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *      public final class Person {
 *          public final String name;
 *          public final boolean isAdult;
 *
 *         {@literal @}Builder
 *          public Person(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
 *              this.name = firstName + " " + lastName;
 *              this.isAdult = age &gt; 20;
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *
 *          ...Jilt will generate the following Builder class:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *     public class PersonBuilder {
 *          public static PersonBuilder person() {
 *              return new PersonBuilder();
 *          }
 *
 *          private String firstName;
 *          private String lastName;
 *          private int age;
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder firstName(String firstName) {
 *              this.firstName = firstName;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder lastName(String lastName) {
 *              this.lastName = lastName;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder age(int age) {
 *              this.age = age;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public Person build() {
 *              return new Person(firstName, lastName, age);
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>
 *          You can place it on a (static) method. In that case, the processor will generate
 *          a Builder for the class that is the return type of that method, and the properties
 *          of the Builder will be all of the method parameters (in the same order they were
 *          declared in the method). The <code>build</code> method will call the annotated method
 *          to obtain an instance of the target class.
 *          <p>
 *          This is especially useful in cases you don't want to or can't modify
 *          the source code of the class you are generating the Builder for.
 *          <p>
 *          For example, given this code:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *      public final class Person {
 *          public final String name;
 *          public final boolean isAdult;
 *
 *          Person(String name, boolean isAdult) {
 *              this.name = name;
 *              this.isAdult = isAdult;
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      public abstract class PersonFactory {
 *         {@literal @}Builder
 *          public static Person make(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
 *              return new Person(firstName + " " + lastName, age &gt; 20);
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *
 *          ...Jilt will generate the following Builder class:
 *
 *          <pre><code>
 *     public class PersonBuilder {
 *          public static PersonBuilder person() {
 *              return new PersonBuilder();
 *          }
 *
 *          private String firstName;
 *          private String lastName;
 *          private int age;
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder firstName(String firstName) {
 *              this.firstName = firstName;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder lastName(String lastName) {
 *              this.lastName = lastName;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public PersonBuilder age(int age) {
 *              this.age = age;
 *              return this;
 *          }
 *
 *          public Person build() {
 *              return PersonFactory.make(firstName, lastName, age);
 *          }
 *      }
 *          </code></pre>
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are different flavors of Builders that can be generated for the same class.
 * The {@link #style} attribute controls what is the variant used in each particular case.
 * <p>
 * A field or constructor/static method parameter can be marked with the {@link Opt} annotation,
 * which means the Builder property extracted from that field or parameter will be optional.
 * See the {@link Opt} annotation documentation for details.
 * <p>
 * The @Builder annotation has also a bunch of (optional) attributes that allow you to
 * customize the generated Builder class:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #className}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #packageName}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setterPrefix}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #factoryMethod}</li>
